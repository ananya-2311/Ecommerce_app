# SHOPPING APP

Made this project under Myntra Hackerramp.

## Techstack:
1. Flutter
2. Firebase, Firestore

## App description:
 Below are the key features of app present in this repo:
1) We have created an attractive UI for an e-commerce app using certain animations and widgets to show various features have we have implemented in this phase.
2) We have used Login password for Authentication using firebase and Cloud Firestore for storing user data.
3) We have created 6 dummy products to show the working of cart and link sharing.
4) Each product is assigned with a shareable link. This link can be shared both within in the app and outside the app.
5) The cart is made fully functional with complete backend integration. Addition and removal of products from cart is possible and is reflected in the database.
6) We also implemented feature of screen sharing by linking our app to Google meet. Flutter doesn't support screen sharing and has no package for it. But as we had mentioned about screen sharing in our key solutions, we tried our best to implement this feature.
